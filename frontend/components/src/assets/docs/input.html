<h3>Behavior</h3>
<p>
    The behavior of the component depend on the value of the property <code>type</code>:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>number</code>:
            <p>
                The text entered by a student is converted to an int or float
                before the grader is called. If the input box is empty then the value will be set to 0.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
               In this mode the component ensures that the student cannot enter a non numeric value.
            </p>
            <b>Important:</b>
            <p>If a student enter the number 0.0 it will be converted to 0.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>text</code>:
            <p>
                In this mode the logic of converting and handling the value entered
                by a student is delegated to the grader. You must cast the text to an int or a float
                and handle the case where the input box is empty by yourself.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>multiline</code>: Behaves like for when the property <code>type</code> is defined to <code>text</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
