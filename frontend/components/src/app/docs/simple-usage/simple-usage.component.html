    <p>
        The usage guide will based on the <code>Sort List</code> component
        of the introduction page. This component allow to sort a list of items by dragging
        them and we will see step by step how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each component documentation page comes with an interactive exercise
        like the following. You can modify the code
        inside the editor and click on the preview button to play with the
        example.

    <h3>Usage explained</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                # Step 1: Declaration
                <p>
                    This block of code represents the <b>declaration</b> of a component.
                    Here we use operator <code>=:</code> to tell the framework to creates new SortList component.
                    After that we specify the property items of the component that will be used to render
                    the items inside the exercise.
                </p>
                <p>In the first example we use the JSON syntax to provides the items of the component. </p>
                <p>In the second example we use a string syntax to provides the items of the component. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                # Step 2: Randomization.
                <p>
                    Once created we have to randomize the items of the list and keep track to the answer inside a grader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first example we just put the id of the items inside a list <code>answer</code> and call
                    <code>random.shuffle()</code> on the items to randomize the list. <br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second example we use the predefined functions <code>parse_string()</code> and
                    <code>remind()</code> of SortList class to do the same thing. The first one will split the string <code>items</code> using the specified
                    separator <code>\n</code> in this case and create a JSON object like in the first example with random id for the items.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                # Step 3: Exercise form
                <p>
                    From this block of code, we define the layout of the exercise and
                    we insert the component in the HTML using the
                    <code>|component</code> filter on the variable that hold the component.
                    This filter will write the html code needed to render the component and map the properties of the component
                    to the HTML element.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                # Step 5 Evaluation
                <p>
                    After the student submit the form to the server to get a
                    grade, the framework will sync the state of the component
                    with the actions of the student. For example in the case of the sort list,
                    When a student reorder the items the component will update the ordering
                    of the property <code>sortlist.items</code>. So we compare the id of the elements on the list send by the student
                    with the saved list <code>answer</code> and update the css property of the items to provide a feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of the second example, we just call the method <code>auto_grade()</code> on the component to auto
                    evaluate the exercise.</p>
