<h3>Representation</h3>
<p>
    Hint is made up of multiple rows of items which can contain html, markdown, MathJax or text content.
    You specify the rows by initializing the property <code>items</code> of the component which is an array of <code>HintItem</code> objects.
    A <code>HintItem</code> object has the following properties:
</p>
<pre>
{
    "content": string, // HTML, markdown, MathJax or textual content of the item.
    "consumed": boolean, // A value indicating whether the hint is consumed by the student.
    "css": string, // optional css classes of the component separated by a space.
}
</pre>

    <h3>Dynamic Hinting</h3>
    <p>
        The default behavior of the component is not dynamic.
        The component will present the next non consumed hint of <code>items</code> array
        each time a student ask for a hint.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create dynamic hints. The component provides the property <code>script</code>.
        The value of this property should be a javascript script. You can create a very
        complex and intelligent hinting mecanism using this property.
    </p>

    <p class="info">
        Combined with <code>CountDown</code> component,
        you can display hints to the student after a delay.
    </p>
