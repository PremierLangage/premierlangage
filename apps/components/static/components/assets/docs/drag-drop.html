<h3>Behavior</h3>
<p>
Drag & Drop refers to both draggable and droppable components.
The difference between the two is that
a droppable component has the property <code>droppable</code> set to <code>true</code>
</p>
<p>
When a draggable component is dropped into a droppable component, the <code>cid</code> of the dragged one
is affected to the property <code>droppedId</code> of the dropped one.
</p>
<p>A draggable component can be dropped into multiple drop zones.</p>
<p>A drop zone can be cleared by dragging it into it's source.</p>
